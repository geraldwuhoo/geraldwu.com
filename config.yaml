about:
  - title: Software Engineering
    description: |
      I'm primarily a developer focused in Object-Oriented Programming and Backend Web Development. Both my professional career and schooling has been focused in software development.

      I am most familiar with the Java, C, Python, and GoLang languages. I also have some limited experience in C++, C#, JavaScript, and Scala.

      If you want to see some of my more notable projects, please visit the [projects](#projects) section. Or, visit my [self-hosted GitLab](https://git.geraldwu.com/gerald) or my [GitHub](https://github.com/98WuG/) to view all of them.

      I'm a Linux systems administrator, focused on cloud-native deployments and infrastructure as code (IaC).

      All of my [services](#selfhosted) are hosted on Docker on a vSphere cluster, backed by central ZFS storage exported as NFS. They are all deployed via some form of IaC with either GitLab CI/CD or via Ansible and docker-compose.

      All of this is hosted on-premise on segregated VLANs with limited inter-VLAN routing rules, behind a self-built firewall/router running pfSense software.

      I am also a [Red Hat Certified System Administrator](https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify/?certId=180-132-714).

projects:
  - title: Omgur &mdash; A FOSS private front-end for Imgur
    link: "https://git.geraldwu.com/gerald/Omgur"
    language: Golang
    image: "https://geraldwu.com/images/imgur-logo.png"
    description: |
      Omgur is a free and open-source private front-end proxy for Imgur, inspired by [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious), [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter), and [Teddit](https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit). Omgur runs with no JavaScript, ads, or tracking. All requests are proxied through the Omgur backend to prevent Imgur from tracking IP or JavaScript fingerprint. Easily self-hostable through the Docker image provided by Gitlab CI/CD configuration.

  - title: Quantum Mechanical Wave Function Propagation
    link: "https://git.geraldwu.com/gerald/QuantumEvolution"
    language: Processing
    image: "https://geraldwu.com/images/quantum.jpg"
    description: |
      A program to evolve arbitrary initial states through time for the one-dimensional Schrodinger Equation and Wave Equation in the absence of a potential field. Highly optimized to run in **real time**. No pre-rendering. Accurate to millions of timesteps before noticeable error propagation. Written in Processing (a fork of Java with a focus on real-time graphing), with a small shell script launcher.
